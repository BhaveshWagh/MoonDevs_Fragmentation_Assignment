## Task-Fragmentation

#### AN assignment to test the fragmentation ability of Developers

My Pick - Fragmentation of Functinality / UI

### My Reasons for Fragmentating it like that

## UI Component Fragments

Modularity: Each UI component has a single responsibility, making it easier to understand, modify, and maintain. It also allows for easier collaboration among team members.

Reusability: Smaller components can be reused in other parts of the application or in different projects, improving development efficiency.

Readability: Smaller components with focused responsibilities are easier to read and comprehend, especially for developers who may need to maintain or extend the codebase.

Scalability: As the application grows, having modular and reusable components simplifies the process of adding new features or modifying existing ones without introducing bugs.


## Custom Hook 

Reuseability: Creating custome hooks it becomes easier to reuse the same logic in other components throughout the application. This promotes code consistency and reduces redundancy.

Readability: The main BurnPage component becomes cleaner, focusing on rendering UI and handling component-level state, while the complex logic is abstracted into the custom hook. This separation makes the code more readable and understandable.

Testability: The logic within the hook can be easily unit-tested independently, ensuring that each piece of functionality works as expected.
